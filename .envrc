# point out to users at commit time that commits need to be signed,
# not once they've done many commits and are trying to push a PR:
git config --local commit.gpgSign true
git config --local tag.gpgSign true

# Create .envrc.local with your Checkmarx credentials (this file is gitignored)
if [ -f .envrc.local ]; then
